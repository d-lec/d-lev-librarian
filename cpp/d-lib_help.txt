- compile "d-lib.cpp" with -std=gnu++11 option.

RUN IN MSWIN:
- Create desktop shortcut & edit it:
- Properties | Layout
- Screen Buffer Size: 86x30
- Window Size: 86x30

RUN IN LINUX:
- Create desktop launcher & edit it:
  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=term
  Exec=gnome-terminal --title="D-LIB" --geometry 86x30 -x /home/d-lib/d-lib
  Comment=
  Terminal=false
  Icon=exec
  Type=Application
  Path=/home/demo/Documents/CPP/
  Name[en_US]=D-LIB

TIPS:
- At startup, do a "ver" to check if serial connection is OK.
- Before live editing, do a "ktoe" to pull in all the knob values.
- Preset files must be in the current directory for F3 preset list names.
- The highlight must be off to use the command line.
- ALL files (dlp, bnk, pre, pro, spi, eeprom, etc.) are text files and are editable.
- Use eeprom_dump to capture a snapshot of your entire system.
- Use eeprom_pump to restore your system, or to perform a factory reset.
